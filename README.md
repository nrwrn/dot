# dot
Dotfiles, currently in migration to `stow` format.

## Stow packages
* `arch`: configs specific to Arch Linux
* `bspwm`: configs for the `bspwm` window manager, also contains related xorg-specific configs (TODO: refactor most of those out)
* `cli`: every platform-agnostic useful cli config
* `extras`: not actually a stow package -- additional files needing more complex methods
* `fun`: collection of fun little bin scripts
* `grafx`: various gui configs not specific to a window manager or environment
* `nrwrn`: configs specific to nrwrn identity
